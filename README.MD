# Project CIPHER

## This project aims to provide a collaborative platform for programmers and developers to share their knowledge and expertise.

 Inspired by Stack Overflow, it fosters a community-driven environment where users can ask questions, receive insightful answers, and contribute to a comprehensive knowledge base.

Key Features:
- Q&A System: Users can post questions, providing clear descriptions and relevant code snippets. Others can offer solutions, vote on the most helpful responses, and leave comments for further clarification.
- Reputation System: Users gain reputation points for asking high-quality questions, providing valuable answers, and participating constructively in the community. This incentivizes engagement and ensures the quality of information.
- Search Functionality: Robust search capabilities enable users to quickly find solutions to their coding challenges and explore a vast repository of programming knowledge.
